# SpringDataREST
This is back-end project. In this project I have used REST API and H2 database. Due to @RepositoryRestResource annotation we don't need controller for this project.

I have used:
1. REST API
2. H2 Dabatabase
3. JPA
4. Postman (for testing)
5. Main focus is on:- @RepositoryRestResource(collectionResourceRel = "Customer", path = "Customer")
6. Also preloaded data into the database
